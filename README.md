# 📚 Rachel Kent — Junior Web Developer | Automation Specialist

Hi, I’m Rachel — a passionate self-taught developer with a background in operations, admin systems, and billing support. I transitioned into tech to build beautiful, functional tools that make everyday life easier and more efficient. My focus is on front-end web development, Python scripting, and automating repetitive tasks.

I love building things that feel intentional — whether it’s a clean webpage, a quick automation script, or a whole new skill set.

## ✍️ Fun Facts

- I'm obsessed with the dark academia aesthetic — think candlelight, moody playlists, and vintage books.
- I’m building a life that feels like *home* first, and everything else (including love, jobs, and peace) flows from that.
- I believe healing is just as productive as hustling — and that self-worth is the foundation of everything.
